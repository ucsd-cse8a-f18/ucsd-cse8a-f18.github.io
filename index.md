<b>Programming Assignments</b> 

Learn by doing!  Most weeks, you will be working on a programming assignment for this class.
You will feel the intense excitement of seeing your work come alive through the computer, and 
also the equally intense frustration of wading through error messages and tricky bugs.  Both of these
are at the heart of what it means to be a computer scientist.  The programming assignments are designed
to invite your creativity, problem solving skills, tenacity, and interests. When you find yourself stuck
during your work on a programming assignment, ask for help:

* Open lab hours

* Instructor and TA office hours

* Private questions to instructors on the class discussion board on Piazza


Remember to always read the programming assignment description carefully.  Some programming assignments will
be **pair-programming** assignments, where you are expected to develop the algorithm and code in close collaboration 
with a partner; others will be **individual** assignments, where you will gain confidence with your own mastery
of the material.

PA0 counts towards 2% of your overall course grade, the rest of the assignments (PA1 through PA8) each count towards 5% 
of your overall course grade.


<a id="help"></a>
<b>Getting help</b> 

The point of lab hours is to get you un-stuck when you're not sure what to do next on an assignment. The job of a tutor in lab hours is not necessarily to solve the problem you asked. The job of the tutor is to make sure you have the knowledge you need to take a productive next step. That means if you ask for help because you don't know how to implement the next method, you should expect that when the tutor leaves you know how to take a first step towards that implementation. You might end up with an idea for simple examples to try first, or a picture that demonstrates a good approach, or some other guide that isn't concrete code. The problem won't be solved, but you will be un-stuck.

When you ask a question on Autograder, a few guidelines:

Give a meaningful question or problem statement in your ticket. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be possible for a tutor to imagine possible situations just from the ticket, and not have to get the full story when arriving at your workstation. For tickets without meaningful questions, tutors are free to use their judgment to remove them from the queue.
Be prepared! When the tutor shows up, you should be ready to reproduce the issue you're having, have a test case that doesn't produce the right output, show them a drawing of the situation you're confused about, etc.
Piazza
You can and should ask questions on Piazza. We have some guidelines and advice for doing so.

The default on our Piazza board is for questions to be private to the question asker and the instructors. We (the instructional staff) will often make private questions public if we think the answers and discussion will be useful to everyone; if we do so we'll switch the author visibility to anonymous (it turns out it's not possible to make it anonymous if the original post isn't anonymous). If you want to be anonymous when a post is publicized, please set it to anonymous initially. Note that we won't publicize obviously-private questions about grades or other sensitive topics. If you want to ask a private question that stays private, just ask us to keep it private in the body of the question.

You are also welcome to ask and answer public questions! Before you do, consider:

Does it contribute to a positive, constructive, and respectful forum for discussion and learning?
Does it contain contain source code or other information that shouldn't be shared class-wide?
Is it a question that's been asked before, that you could find via searching?
If you make a post that violates these guidelines, we may make it private and remind you of these guidelines. Overall, our goal is to make the public content on Piazza constructive and relevant for everyone.

In your question, clearly indicate the problem you're having or question you need answered, and feel free to share any supporting code or screenshots that may help us understand what's going on. If it's a simple technical issue or clarification, you might get a direct answer. If it's a question about an assignment, expect to get questions back that lead you towards a better understanding, not an immediate answer that solves your problem.

We will, for each assignment, aggregate together a frequently asked questions post that draws from questions we receive in office hours and via Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post, we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new important questions and answers come in.

For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official. They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by accident. “My classmate said so on Piazza” is not a legitimate justification in most arguments, though they may indeed lead you in helpful directions.

Finally, a note about the pedagogic value of communication – a huge amount of modern computer science happens via collaboration, in text, online. Sites like Stack Overflow and Github hold incredible wealths of information generated through asking and answering questions. Computer science research, large system development, and cutting-edge design happens through professional, high-volume mailing lists. Practicing using Piazza professionally prepares you for these situations, so do it mindfully.


<a id="exams"></a>
<b>Exams</b> There will be two exams during the quarter, held in the evenings during Week 3 (**Thursday 10/18/2018	8pm-
9:50pm**) and Week 7 (**Wednesday 11/14/2018	8pm-9:50pm**) of the Fall quarter.  The Final exam is on Wednesday of exam week
(**Wednesday 12/12/2018	7pm-9:59pm**).  There are no makeup exams.  See <a href="#Grading">grading section</a> below for the 
policy on missed exams.

## Policies

<a id="materials"></a>
<h3>Materials</h3>

There is no textbook for the course. The schedule above will link to all the
reference material you need for the course.

To get credit for lectures and discussions, you must have an iClicker. You
can register it through [https://goo.gl/forms/0xnf9uXvrgsX7Guq2]. We use clickers and have you
work on problems in lecture because there’s quite a bit of evidence that
sitting and listening passively to lecture [probably isn’t the best way to
teach or learn
science](https://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963).

FILL IN: Piazza, Gradescope, Github repo, Autograder

[The documentation for the Java
language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/), while not required reading,
will be linked to from some assignments and is always a useful reference
while programming.



<a name="engage"></a>
<h3 id="engage">Engagement</h3>

We highly recommend actively participating in class, attending discussion, and completing the weekly review quizzes. Regularly
engaging with the class in these ways counts towards the Engagement component of your overall score.

This score is calculated on a weekly basis (starting in Week 1).  The maximum number of points you can earn in one week is 6.
The lowest weekly participation score will be dropped when calculating your overall engagement average.

Earn engagement points by:
* __In class participation via iClickers__  In Weeks 1 through 10 (starting with the second lecture of the quarter), you will 
earn credit for attending and participating in lecture (2 points each) and discussion section (1 point each, up to a maximum 
of 2 points per week). 
Clicker questions will be graded for participation only and not for correctness of the response. 
Full credit for clicker points for a given day will be 
awarded for clicking in at least 80/% of the time that day. Forgetting your clicker counts as missing a class, so please 
remember to bring it! _Do not attempt to falsify iClicker or discussion participation or review quiz submissions; this would be considered a violation of academic integrity._

* __Weekly (P)review quiz__ Online quizzes review the week's material and preview some upcoming examples each week. You can 
submit your answers to each quiz as many times as you like. The latest submission before 11pm on Sunday will count towards 
your engagement score. Each weekly review quiz will be worth 6 points.  Review quizzes will stay available even after the 
deadline; in the past, students have found working through them to be helpful when studying for exams.
_The review quiz must be completed independently and individually. You may refer to your class notes and resources linked from 
this website, 
but not other references. You may not share information about the review quiz with others, take the review quiz in someone 
else's name, or ask anyone for prior knowledge about the review quiz._


We encourage you to find your preferred method for staying engaged with the course.  There are lots of ways to earn
full credit for a week's engagement.  For example: (1) attending all lectures (for the section in which you're enrolled); or
(2) attending two lectures and two discussion sections; or (3) answering all questions on the review quiz correctly; or (4) 
attending two lectures and getting two answers correct on the review  quiz; etc.

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

There will be three total exams in the course: two during the quarter (also
called “midterms”) and a final exam. The midterms will be in the evening during
the quarter. They will primarily contain content from the weeks leading up to
them. Since the programming content is cumulative, the second exam will
necessarily contain content from the first exam, as well.

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you
must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your
own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the
exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations).

The first two exams will each be worth 8% of your final grade. The final exam
will be worth 24% of your final grade. The final exam will have a specific
structure – it will be broken into three parts corresponding to material from
the first exam, the second exam, and the remainder of the course. Your grade
for each midterm will be the *maximum* of the midterm grade and the score you
get on the corresponding part of the final exam.

For example, if you get 50% of the points for midterm 1 and 100% of the points
for midterm 2, and then score a 75% on part 1 of the final, 25% on part 2, and
100% on part 3, you would get:

- MAX(0.5, 0.75) * 8 = 6 points for midterm 1 (0.75 was higher, so the final
  increased the midterm score!)
- MAX(1, 0.25) * 8 = 8 points for midterm 2 (0.25 was lower, so the original
  midterm score was used)
- 0.75 * 8 + 0.25 * 8 + 1 * 0.8 = 16 points for the final exam (the score on
  the final exam is the same regardless of how the midterms went)
- A total of 30 out of 40 exam points towards your final grade

This policy also covers what happens if you miss a midterm for any reason. If
you are absent for a midterm, you get a 0 initially, and then whatever score
you get on the final for that section will be applied to your midterm grade.
There are no make-up midterms, and the final exam policy is governed by the
[university's
policies](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/).

<h3 id="lab">Labs</h3>

Along with the course, you are enrolled in a lab section, which meets each
Tuesday in one of the student labs in the (newly renovated) basement of the CSE building.
You will work in a group in lab.  We will assign the groups and group assignments may 
change from week to week: you are starting your journey into Computer Science and we want
to help you meet your classmates who will be with you along the way.  All labs must be finished
in the allotted class time.  As a group, you will create a lab report each week and your TA will review
it and give you feedback.

You must attend the lab section for which you are enrolled.

<h3 id="si">Supplemental Instruction</h3>


<a id="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading</h3>

Your grade will be computed from:

<ul>
  <li>42% programming assignments (2% for PA0, 5% for each of PA1 through PA8)</li>
  <li>40% exams (8% each for two midterms, 24% for a final exam)</li>
  <li>10% lab work (completed in lab each week)</li>
  <li>10% engagement</li>
</ul>

Yes, this adds up to 102% .


After your weighted average is calculated, letter grades will be assigned 
based on the following grading scale:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr align="center" padding="10">
<td>A+</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>A-</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>D, F</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>&nbsp; >97&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 93-96.99 &nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 90-92.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 87-89.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 83-86.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 80-82.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 77-79.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 73-76.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 65-72.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; Below 64.99&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall class performance), but we guarantee that we will 
not adjust the scale to make it harder to get a better grade.
In addition, you must pass the final exam in order to pass the course.

## Where to go for additional support

### IDEA Engineering Student Center
The IDEA Engineering Student Center, located just off the lobby of Jacobs Hall, is a hub for student engagement, academic enrichment, personal/professional development, leadership, community involvement, and a respectful learning environment for all.  The Center offers a variety of programs, listed in the IDEA Center Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/ (you are welcome to Like this page!) and the Center web site at http://idea.ucsd.edu/.  The IDEA Center programs support both undergraduate students and graduate students.


### Prevention and Reporting of Harrassment & Discrimination

The Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD) provides assistance to students, faculty, and staff 
regarding reports of bias, harassment, and discrimination. OPHD is the UC San Diego Title IX office. Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972 is the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions that are recipients of 
federal funds. All students have the right to an educational environment that is free from harassment and discrimination.

Students have options for reporting incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment. Sexual violence includes sexual 
assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Information about reporting options may be obtained at OPHD at 
(858) 534-8298, ophd@ucsd.edu or http://ophd.ucsd.edu. Students may receive confidential assistance at CARE at the Sexual 
Assault Resource Center at (858) 534-5793, sarc@ucsd.edu or http://care.ucsd.edu or Counseling and Psychological Services 
(CAPS) at (858) 534-3755 or http://caps.ucsd.edu.

Students may feel more comfortable discussing their particular concern with a trusted employee. This may be a student affairs 
staff member, a department Chair, a faculty member or other University official. These individuals have an obligation to 
report incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment to OPHD. This does not necessarily mean that a formal complaint will 
be filed.

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help.
