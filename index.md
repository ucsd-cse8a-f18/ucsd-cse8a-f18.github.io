<h3>Sections</h3>

You are enrolled in a specific lecture section and a specific lab section, and
you cannot attend the lecture or lab for another section (due to space
constraints). You can attend any discussion section(s) you want.

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

There will be three total exams in the course: two during the quarter (also
called “midterms”) and a final exam. The midterms will be in the evening during
the quarter. They will primarily contain content from the weeks leading up to
them. Since the programming content is cumulative, the second exam will
necessarily contain content from the first exam, as well.

Seats will be assigned for all exam sessions and announced beforehand, and you
must bring your school ID to the exam. All work on exams is to be done on your
own, and you are not allowed to use any electronics or study aids during the
exam (aside from those needed for University-approved academic accommodations).

The first two exams will each be worth 8% of your final grade. The final exam
will be worth 24% of your final grade. The final exam will have a specific
structure – it will be broken into three parts corresponding to material from
the first exam, the second exam, and the remainder of the course. Your grade
for each midterm will be the *maximum* of the midterm grade and the score you
get on the corresponding part of the final exam.

For example, if you get 50% of the points for midterm 1 and 100% of the points
for midterm 2, and then score a 75% on part 1 of the final, 25% on part 2, and
100% on part 3, you would get:

- MAX(0.5, 0.75) * 8 = 6 points for midterm 1
- MAX(1, 0.25) * 8 = 8 points for midterm 2
- 0.75 * 8 + 0.25 * 8 + 100 * 0.8 = 16 points for the final exam
- A total of exam points
